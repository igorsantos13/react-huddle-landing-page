### Learning process

As I was looking for a tool to help me to deal with CSS, Styled Components was my first choice, I was wondering how hard it would be to learn it, but actually it takes a few minutes to learn the basics, one thing that you have to be careful is spliting real components to styled ones, as your application is getting larger it can be difficult to track where each file is.

By defining the component and the HTML element the syntax is pretty much similar to CSS, also gives you cool ways to get along with boring things from CSS.

### Conclusion

I loved to take this challenge to learn Styled Components, such a greate experience, I must delve deeper into SC and CSS itself, and about React, I'm feeling more and more confortable with this framework/library, very fun to code and to study, feeling even more excited to work with React.
